It requires decomposing the matrix to the sum of Pauli terms. 

Decomposition involves only terms consisting of the same matrices, i.e.: II, XX, YY, ZZ, and the coefficients are from the set [-1/2, -1, 0, 1, 1/2].

The ansatz you can use is: (RX I) CX (HI) |00>, where angle in RX is your variational parameter.

You can find an explanation of VQE in this blog post, You can also find links to further resources there.

You can just search through all angles for RX, you donâ€™t need to use any optimizers like gradient descent.


[1 0 0 0; 
0 0 -1 0;
0 -1 0 0; 
0 0 0 1]

= 0.5*II -0.5*XX + 0.5*ZZ - 0.5*YY

  resultZ[0] = MeasZ(reg[0]);
  resultZ[1] = MeasZ(reg[1]);
  
  resultX[0] = MeasX(reg[0]);
  resultX[1] = MeasX(reg[1]);
  
  resultY[0] = MeasY(reg[0]);
  resultY[1] = MeasY(reg[1]);
