# QosfTask4

This is my first attempt at task 4 of the quantum mentorship screening task. 

In this VQE algorithm, I searched through different Rx rotation angles and found that pi gave the lowest expected value, which was -1. Therefore, I conclude that the lowest eignvalue of the matrix given in the question

[1 0 0 0; 
0 0 -1 0;
0 -1 0 0; 
0 0 0 1]

is -1.
